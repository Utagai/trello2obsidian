:warning: **NOTE**: This script uses Power-Up API key & tokens. Make your own [here](https://trello.com/power-ups/admin/new). :warning:

Converts your Trello boards into Obsidian Kanban Markdown files.

This isn't really ergonomic to use... check `index.ts` and update accordingly. It's relatively small.

Some considerations:

- `listHeaderCardNames` probably needs an update for your own personal situation.
- You need to set `API_KEY` and `API_TOKEN` in your environment accordingly.
  - Make one [here](https://trello.com/power-ups/admin/new)!
- Run this with `npm run start`.
- Good luck.
