# trello2obsidian
Converts your Trello boards into Obsidian Kanban Markdown files.

This isn't really ergonomic to use... check `index.ts` and update accordingly. It's relatively small.

Some considerations:
- `listHeaderCardNames` probably needs an update for your own personal situation.
- You need to set `API_KEY` and `API_TOKEN` in your environment accordingly.
- Run this with `npm run start`.
- Good luck.
